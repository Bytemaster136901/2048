# 2048

â€¢How to play:
The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048; however, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers.
**[TIP when playing]: The main cheat/strategy for 2048 Game is to keep the highest tile in the corner and do not move it. And then play with only 2 (or 3 sometimes) arrow keys and move the other higher tiles towards the same corner. If you follow this 2048 game hack then there is 80% chance to achieve the 2048 tile.**
